# Induction--2025

### DAY 1
On the very first day of the induction, the program started with the blessings of God. We entered gurudwara sahib of our college and we did japji sahib paath. Then the kirtani jatha recited shabads and we ended the program with Ardaas.
Then we went to auditorium. One side of the hall was filled with CSE students and other side IT students were sitted. Each one of the student had excitement on the face.
The first guest of the day was Dr. Akshay Giddar Sir who congratulated and motivated all of us for our new beginning in this college. He guided how to be positive and never give up on anything.
The next guest was Dr. Ravinder Garg sir who guided us for our next 4 years in this college.
