# Induction--2025

### DAY 1
On the very first day of the induction, the program started with the blessings of God. We entered gurudwara sahib of our college and we did japji sahib paath. Then the kirtani jatha recited shabads and we ended the program with Ardaas followed by langar.
Then we went to auditorium. One side of the hall was filled with CSE students and other side IT students were sitted. Each one of the student had excitement on the face.
The first guest of the day was Dr. Akshay Giddar Sir who congratulated and motivated all of us for our new beginning in this college. He guided how to be positive and never give up on anything.
The next guest was Dr. Ravinder Garg sir who guided us for our next 4 years in this college.
After that we all were given 30 minutes break to have lunch. back to the auditorium, we all were introduced to NCC cadets of our college. They explained what all oppurtunities we get in NCC and asked us to be the part of NCC.
We all then went to Computer Science Department where different different teachers came and explained us about our academics. Firstly we  were told about the mission amd vision of the cousre we are pursing. teachers also told us about the examination patterns, how to focus on studies for good placements, which teacher to contact for what purpose etc. Then we went to visit all the labs, classrooms and libraries of Computer science Department.
