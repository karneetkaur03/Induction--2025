# Induction--2025

### DAY 1
On the very first day of the induction, the program started with the blessings of God. We entered gurudwara sahib of our college and we did japji sahib paath. Then the kirtani jatha recited shabads and we ended the program with Ardaas.
Then we went to auditorium. One side of the hall was filled with CSE students and other side IT students were sitted. Each one of the student had excitement on the face.
